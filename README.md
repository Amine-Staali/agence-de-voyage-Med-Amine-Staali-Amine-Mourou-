The menu offers six options:

Add a flight record
Display a flight record
Delete a flight record
Modify a flight record
Check if a flight record exists according to specific dates
Exit the program
The user is prompted to enter their selection, and the program then calls the corresponding function based on the user's input. For example, if the user chooses option 1, the function add_voy will be called to add a new flight record to the "voyage.txt" file. If the user chooses option 4, the function modify_voy will be called to modify an existing flight record.

The program also closes the "voyage.txt" and "temp.txt" files before returning
